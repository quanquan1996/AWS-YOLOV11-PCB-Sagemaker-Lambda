This is a placeholder file. Replace this with an actual PCB image for testing.

To use this test script:
1. Place a PCB image in the current directory and name it "test_image.jpg"
2. Or set the TEST_IMAGE_PATH environment variable to point to your test image
3. Run the test.py script

Example:
export TEST_IMAGE_PATH=/path/to/your/pcb_image.jpg
python test.py
